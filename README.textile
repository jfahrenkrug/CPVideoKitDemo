h1. CPVideoKitDemo for Cappuccino

You need to serve this app from a webserver, because Flash has certain restrictions when it comes to accessing local files.
I have included a Sinatra server, just start it with

  ruby testserver.rb
  
Now you can open the app at "http://localhost:4567/index.html":http://localhost:4567/index.html!

Have fun!
